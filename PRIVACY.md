Wordwyrm doesn't track, log, or share your personal information.

## Third-party integration

By default, the app uses an Open Library API. Open Library is a project of the Internet Archive.
See [Internet Archive's Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Policy](https://archive.org/about/terms.php).

If using Google API Keys, see the
[Google Cloud Privacy Notice](https://cloud.google.com/terms/cloud-privacy-notice) as well as
[Google Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

This app does not use either of these APIs to collect any data on users.
